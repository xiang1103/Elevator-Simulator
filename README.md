# Elevator-Simulator
Simulating an elevator in Python and implement my version of the algorithm to pick up and drop off passengers. The process mimics how an elevator works in real life, but a bit harder because everything is through software 

## Process 
- The elevator object is the main object for carrying and going through 
- The floors are made of floor objects which can call the elvator 
- The user side to actually interact with the elevator, which would be implemented in the main file 


## To-Dos  
- [x] floor object 
- [x] elevator object 
- [x] implement the loading and offloading on the elevator algorithm
- [x] implement floor selection to go to algorithm
